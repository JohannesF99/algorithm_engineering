The original tool was released in the early 2000s.

## Functionality

The profiler supports a range of platforms, including Intel processors and most of the operating systems.
It can analyze how well the programm utilizes it's threads and helps to identify snippets that can be parallelised and optimized.
Also it works with many IDEs, which makes it easier for developers to incorporate performance analysis into their workflow and has a wide range of tools like CPU profiling, memory profiling, threading analysis, and GPU analysis
