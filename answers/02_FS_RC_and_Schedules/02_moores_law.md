There’s plenty of room at the Top: What
will drive computer performance after Moore’s law?

# Performance gains after Moore’s law ends

## Intro

 The Figure "Performance gains after Moore’s law ends" explains the improvements we will see in the future. When talking about this topic, there are always the keywords "Top" and "Bottom" included. This figure will focus on the optimizations at the "Top".
 
 "Bottom" refers to Moore's Law, stating that every 2 years, the number of transistors and with that the computational power will double.

 In contrast, the "Top" refers to the top of the tech stack, where the computing power can be increased through optimization of software, algorithms and the hardware architecture.

## The main pillars at the top

In every part of the main pillars, there are specific use cases, where optimization can be used to improve the performance.

### Software
To improve the performance from software, the software needs to get restructured. In the past, many companys valued the time to developed software more than the actual performance. If software is free of so called software bloat, like inefficient datastructures or is targeted to a specific hardware, so the software can make use of hardware-specific feautures such as multi-core CPUs, we will see hughe improvements in performance.

### Algorithms
The next big pillar are algorithms. While well-known algorithms get faster over time, at some point, there will be no significant improvement to any known algorithm. Thats why  there is an opportunity to create new, fast and improved algorithms. Like the algorithms, there are always new things in computer science. Today these things are artificial intelligience and machine learning. With the rise of those topics, newer and faster algorithms can rise, too.

### Hardware architecture
The last pillar of the "Top" is the hardware architecture. This pillar is all about optimizing and streamling the hardware to fit the software's needs. In general, when we have a specific problem, which should be optimized, we can look at the hardware and select the best hardware architecture for this problem. This can e.g. be the use of few simple core instead of one simple core to make use of parallelism.

## Difference between the top and bottom

While those improvements sound quite good overall, it must be noted, that the optimizations at the top do not happen continuously but rather spontaneously, in contrast to the bottom where the improvements happened after almost every two years.
