Static Schedules: OpenMP vs. C++ Threads

## Report

I really liked this topic, because it shows very clearly the things we learned in this course and the pros of OpenMP against typicall C++ threads.
I think just by the looks of it, OpenMP was less scary then the C++ threads, because the code looks less complex on the first glance. While C++ threads are more verbose, which can be good, because you can exactly see, what's happening, it appears more complex. With OpenMP you can focus on the actual logic without the need to constantly think about how the threads will behave. This is one of the biggest pros of OpenMP, which my teampartner and i experienced first hand in our course project, where we wrote our application without any parallelization and added the OpenMP directives afterwards. And besides a few problems early on, it was very easy to speed up our application - which is the main selling point of OpenMP (for me at least :D)
