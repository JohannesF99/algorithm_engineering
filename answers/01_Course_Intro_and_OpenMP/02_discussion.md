# Topic 1
The Linux Project (Chapter 1.7.4, Aside)

## Discussion

I found that paragraph of how linux came to be especially interresting, because until know i didn't know how Linus Torvalds started his project. The idea to use a mailing list for feedback on the mimix operating system to gather ideas for his own, is so simple but cool.

Especially in hindsight, it's really funny to me, that in this email, Linus Torvals explicit states that his project "won't be big and professional" - knowing that today, most of the servers in the world run on linux.

Another thing i found really interresting, is how the creation of linux lead to another big software developers today use on a daily basis: Git. Because the work on the open-source linux kernel was too much to handle, Linus Torvals created Git to controll the condributions and versioning. 

This goes to show, how in the age of the internet, one simple idea can change the whole world. And in this context, i think it's crazy to imagen how our world would look like, if we wouldn't have the tools to our disposal we have today. Maybe someone else would create them or they may would never be created in the first place and other tools would be common for developers.

# Topic 2
Storage Hirarchy (Figure 1.9)

## Discussion

Another topic i found quite interresting is the Figure 1.9. The image shows the storage hirarchy going from the bottom with remote secondarystorage, to the top with L0 registers.

What's really cool to see is the inverse proportion of the storage types. Slower types of storage are much larger and cheaper than their counterparts, which is also refelected in the graphical representation.

And even though the hirarchy of those storage types will probably stay the same, i think it's interresting to think about how storage has evolved until today and how it will evolve in the future. One common joke is, how many computer in the early days had just a few kilobytes of hard drive storage, something today is not imaginable.

And in this context i think about how this evolution has impacted developers over time, especially in different areas. Because disk space was so rare in the past, most applications needed to be extremly slim, performant and bug-free. There were virtually no possibilitys to update the code after the release. This is a big contrast to nowaday, where disk space is trivial. In game development can this be seen, where big games can take up to 100GBs.
